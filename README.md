# Class Countdown

## Becasue lets be honest, we're all lazy clock-watchers
This is the source code for the [Class Countdown app][1], which is avalible on the google play store.

### What it does
The app is very simple. It just displays a countdown for the time remaining in the current class period (which is defined in a database).

Below is an example image of what it looks like with a given class.

### Setup
Setup was intended to be simple. To add / setup a schedule tap on the Settings button, then the Edit Schedules button. From there you can create new schedules or edit pre-existing schedules.

Below is a demo of the setup

### How do I override the automatic setting
If your school has a day that reqires an abnormal schedule (such as wednessdays schedule being applied on a Monday), you can override the automatically set schedule by tapping on the Settings button, and then selecting the schedule to apply from the list of radio buttons (unselecting Automatic).

Just remember to return it to automatic, as this does not reset.
